# Celldweller #

Celldweller is a Java application aimed at simulating cellular automata in 2D space. 
It can be used to designate different scenarios and test different automata rules on them. 

For more info on cellular automata, check [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Rule_space)

## Building ##
Celldweller uses [Logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) for logging. So, before attempting to build, [download it](http://logback.qos.ch/download.html). 
Unzip the package, then run `mvn install`.

From here on, the project can be built as any other maven project.
